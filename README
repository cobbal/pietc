This is an implementation of the piet programming language described
at http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html

There exist several piet interpreters, but I suspect that the reason
this elegant language has caught on in the enterprise setting is
primarily effeciency concerns. Compiling piet programs will help to
remove this primary obstacle to piet adoption.

This really is still in major hack stage, mostly I'm just doing it
have fun with llvm.
